# JavaScript Events Practice

This project is a practice repository for JavaScript events. It includes examples and exercises to help understand and work with various types of events in JavaScript.

## Project Structure


- `index.html`: The HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains event handlers and functions.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `README.md`: This file that describes the project.

## Getting Started

## Examples

### Example 1: Click Event
In `script.js`, we have an example of a click event handler that changes the background color of a div when clicked.

```javascript
document.getElementById('myDiv').addEventListener('click', function() {
    this.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
});

document.getElementById('myParagraph').addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
    this.textContent = 'Mouse is over me!';
});
